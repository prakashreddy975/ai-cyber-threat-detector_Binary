# Cybersecurity Exploits and Vulnerabilities - Detailed Report

This document outlines several significant cyber security vulnerabilities, their mechanisms, and potential impacts.

## 1. Markdown-Based Exploits (Parsing Vulnerabilities)
Modern applications often use Markdown parsers, which can be exploited if they allow insecure rendering (e.g., embedding HTML/JavaScript).

### CVE-2023-0835: Markdown-PDF Local File Read
*   **Description:** The `markdown-pdf` npm package (v11.0.0) fails to validate user input, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files from the server's local file system.
*   **Exploit Vector:** A malicious Markdown file containing scripts is converted, triggering file reading via `XMLHttpRequest`.
*   **Payload Example:**
    ```markdown
    <script>
    x = new XMLHttpRequest;
    x.onload=function(){document.write(this.responseText)};
    x.open("GET","file:///etc/passwd");
    x.send();
    </script>
    ```

### CVE-2023-2110: Obsidian Desktop Local File Access
*   **Description:** Improper path handling in Obsidian desktop (prior to 1.2.8) allows a crafted webpage to access local files via `app://local/<absolute-path>`.
*   **Impact:** RCE or file exfiltration when a user opens a malicious Markdown file.

### Markdownify RCE (CVE-2023-41370)
*   **Description:** Markdownify 1.4.1 allowed remote code execution (RCE) because the "nodeIntegration" option was enabled, permitting arbitrary JS execution.

## 2. Web Application & Server Exploits

### SQL Injection in FortiClient EMS (CVE-2023-48788)
*   **Description:** A critical SQL injection vulnerability in FortiClient EMS allowed unauthorized attackers to execute arbitrary commands or code.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise (Medusa ransomware group has utilized this).

### Local File Inclusion (LFI)
*   **Description:** LFI attacks occur when an application allows a user to submit input that changes the file path in a request, often used to read sensitive files.
*   **Mechanism:** Using techniques like `../` to traverse directories to access files like `c:\windows\win.ini` or `/etc/passwd`.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Description:** Injection of malicious scripts into trusted websites, often stealing user sessions or credentials.
*   **Example:** `<script>alert('xss');</script>` inserted into a form field that is subsequently rendered.

## 3. Supply Chain & Tool Exploits

### vscode-markdown-pdf Pathname Traversal (CVE-2024-7738)
*   **Description:** A vulnerability in yzane `vscode-markdown-pdf` (1.5.0) allowed local pathname traversal.

### Markdown-to-jsx XSS (CVE-2024-21535)
*   **Description:** A vulnerability in `markdown-to-jsx` where unclosed quotation marks or malicious syntax can lead to XSS.

## 4. Prevention and Mitigation
*   **Input Sanitization:** Always sanitize user input, especially if rendering HTML or Markdown.
*   **Disable Dangerous Features:** Disable raw HTML rendering and JavaScript execution in Markdown parsers.
*   **Update Libraries:** Keep all libraries (npm, python packages) updated to patch known CVEs.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement strict CSPs to prevent XSS.
