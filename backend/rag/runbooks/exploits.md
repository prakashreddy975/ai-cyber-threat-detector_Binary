# Exploitation & Vulnerability Abuse Runbook

## Overview
Exploitation involves actively abusing a vulnerability to gain unauthorized access, execute code, or escalate privileges.

## Threat Description
- Targets known CVEs
- Often follows reconnaissance
- Can lead to data breach or lateral movement

## Common Exploit Vectors
- Web application vulnerabilities
- Outdated services (FTP, SMB, RDP)
- Misconfigured APIs
- Deserialization flaws
- Command injection

## Indicators of Exploitation
- Requests with unusual payload sizes
- Abnormal `trans_depth`
- Repeated failed connections followed by success
- Sudden privilege escalation
- Unusual outbound traffic

## ML Features Commonly Triggered
- response_body_len
- trans_depth
- smean / dmean
- ct_srv_dst anomalies
- protocol/service mismatch

## Risk Classification
- MEDIUM: Exploit attempt without success
- HIGH: Successful exploitation indicators
- CRITICAL: Privilege escalation or data access

## Immediate Response
1. Isolate affected host.
2. Preserve memory and disk state.
3. Block exploit source IP.

## Investigation
- Identify CVE being exploited.
- Review application logs.
- Validate integrity of binaries and configs.

## Containment
- Patch vulnerability immediately.
- Rotate credentials.
- Revoke compromised tokens.

## Recovery
- Restore from clean backups if required.
- Validate no persistence mechanisms exist.

## Post-Incident
- Update vulnerability management system.
- Add exploit signatures to detection rules.
- Retrain ML model with confirmed samples.

## False Positives
- Penetration testing
- Vulnerability scanners

## Escalation
- HIGH: Incident Response Lead
- CRITICAL: Legal + Executive notification
